## üìä CATEGORIZED FAILURES

### **Category 1: Market Resolution Issues (5 tests)** üî¥
**Root Cause**: Tests expecting market to be resolved, but resolution not completing

1. **Test 1**: "should prevent reentrancy during claim winnings" (line 102)
   - Error: `Market not resolved`
   - Fix: Ensure `finalizeResolution()` is called with proper signer

2. **Test 5**: "should prevent underflow in winnings calculation" (line 380)
   - Error: `Market not resolved`
   - Fix: Complete resolution sequence

3. **Test 6**: "should prevent winning on losing outcome" (line 424)
   - Error: `Market not resolved`
   - Fix: Complete resolution sequence

4. **Test 9**: "should prevent race conditions in claims" (line 623)
   - Error: `Market not resolved`
   - Fix: Complete resolution sequence

5. **Test 13**: "should prevent double claiming" (security-and-edge-cases.test.js:294)
   - Error: `Market not resolved`
   - Fix: Complete resolution sequence

**Common Pattern**: All failing at `claimWinnings()` with "Market not resolved"
**Systematic Fix**: Add `.connect(deployer)` to `finalizeResolution()` calls

---

### **Category 2: Fee Deduction Not Accounted For (3 tests)** üü°
**Root Cause**: Tests expect full amount but fees are being deducted

1. **Test 2**: "should handle large bets without enabling front-running" (line 174)
   - Expected: 1000000...
   - Actual: 985000... (98.5% = 1.5% fee taken)
   - Fix: Account for 1.5% fee (baseFee 0.5% + platformFee 0.5% + creatorFee 0.5%)

2. **Test 8**: "should prevent race conditions in bet placement" (line 588)
   - Expected: 100000...
   - Actual: 98500... (1.5% fee)
   - Fix: Account for fees

3. **Test 10**: "should prevent DoS through state bloat" (line 688)
   - Expected: 10000...
   - Actual: 9850... (1.5% fee)
   - Fix: Account for fees

**Systematic Fix**: Update all balance assertions to account for 1.5% total fees

---

### **Category 3: Expected Revert But Didn't (4 tests)** üü†
**Root Cause**: Tests expecting transactions to revert but they succeed

1. **Test 3**: "should prevent resolution front-running" (line 203)
   - Expected: Transaction to be reverted
   - Actual: Transaction succeeded
   - Issue: Front-running protection may not be working as expected

2. **Test 12**: "should prevent betting after market ends" (security-and-edge-cases.test.js:267)
   - Expected: Transaction to be reverted
   - Actual: Transaction succeeded
   - Issue: Betting after endTime should be blocked

3. **Test 14**: "should enforce betting period boundaries" (security-and-edge-cases.test.js:399)
   - Expected: Transaction to be reverted
   - Actual: Transaction succeeded
   - Issue: Boundary enforcement not working

4. **Test 15**: "should handle market at exact end time" (security-and-edge-cases.test.js:621)
   - Expected: Transaction to be reverted
   - Actual: Transaction succeeded
   - Issue: Exact endTime boundary not enforced

**Systematic Fix**: Check timing logic in tests vs contract implementation

---

### **Category 4: Expected NOT to Revert But Did (1 test)** üîµ
**Root Cause**: Test expects success but transaction reverts

1. **Test 4**: "should prevent overflow in total volume calculation" (line 344)
   - Expected: Transaction NOT to be reverted
   - Actual: Transaction reverted
   - Issue: May be hitting Solidity's built-in overflow protection (Solidity 0.8+)

**Fix**: Adjust test expectations for Solidity 0.8+ automatic overflow protection

---

### **Category 5: Wrong Error Type (1 test)** üü£

1. **Test 7**: "should prevent unauthorized fee updates" (line 547)
   - Expected: `OwnableUnauthorizedAccount` error
   - Actual: `Timelock not expired` error
   - Issue: Timelock protection is firing before ownership check
   - Fix: Adjust test to expect timelock error OR bypass timelock first

---

### **Category 6: Wrong Market State (1 test)** üü§

1. **Test 11**: "should handle zero total bets gracefully" (security-and-edge-cases.test.js:122)
   - Expected: MarketState to be one of [2, 3, 4] (Resolved/Finalized/Canceled)
   - Actual: MarketState is 1 (Active)
   - Issue: Market not transitioning to expected state
   - Fix: Ensure market resolution/cancellation logic runs

---

### **Category 7: beforeEach Hook Errors (2 tests)** ‚ö´

1. **Test 16**: beforeEach hook in enhanced-nft-staking.test.js (line 53)
   - Error: `missing argument: types/values length mismatch (count=0, expectedCount=1)`
   - Issue: Contract deployment missing required parameter
   - Fix: Check EnhancedNFTStaking constructor arguments

2. **Test 17**: beforeEach hook in governance.test.js (line 46)
   - Error: `missing argument: types/values length mismatch (count=0, expectedCount=1)`
   - Issue: Contract deployment missing required parameter
   - Fix: Check Governance constructor arguments
