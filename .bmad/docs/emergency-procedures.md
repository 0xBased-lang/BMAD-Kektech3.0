## 🛑 EMERGENCY PAUSE PROCEDURES

### When to Pause

**Immediate Pause Triggers:**
- Active exploit detected
- Critical vulnerability discovered
- Funds at immediate risk
- Owner instructs pause
- Unauthorized contract behavior

**Evaluation Required:**
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Community reports of issues
- Failed transactions
- Incorrect calculations
- Unexpected state changes

### How to Pause

#### Option 1: Manual Pause (Fastest)

```bash
# Emergency pause script
npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/pause-all.js --network [NETWORK]

# Or direct contract interaction
npx hardhat console --network [NETWORK]
> const market = await ethers.getContractAt("BMADPredictionMarket", "0x...")
> await market.pause()
```

#### Option 2: Defender Sentinel (Automated)

```javascript
// Pre-configured pause trigger
// Activates automatically on suspicious activity
// Notification sent to team
```

#### Option 3: Multisig (Mainnet Production)

```bash
# Submit pause proposal to multisig
# Requires 2-3 signatures
# Execute when threshold met
```

### After Pausing

1. **Assess Situation**
   - What triggered the pause?
   - Is exploit ongoing?
   - How many users affected?
   - What funds are at risk?

2. **Contain Issue**
   - Stop all contract interactions
   - Preserve evidence (logs, transactions)
   - Document timeline
   - Identify root cause

3. **Communicate**
   - Notify team immediately
   - Draft public statement
   - Update status page
   - Engage community transparently

4. **Fix & Resume**
   - Develop fix
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy update
   - Unpause gradually
   - Monitor closely

## 💰 EMERGENCY WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES

### When to Withdraw

**Critical Scenarios Only:**
- Contract compromised beyond repair
- Private keys potentially exposed
- Critical vulnerability with no quick fix
- Funds must be moved to safety immediately

### Withdrawal Methods

#### Method 1: Standard Emergency Withdrawal

```bash
# Withdraw all funds to safe address
npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/withdraw-funds.js --network [NETWORK]

# Parameters needed:
# - Target safe address
# - Contract address
# - Owner signature
```

#### Method 2: User Self-Withdrawal

```bash
# Enable emergency withdrawal for users
npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/enable-user-withdrawal.js --network [NETWORK]

# Users can then call:
# contract.emergencyWithdraw()
```

### After Emergency Withdrawal

1. **Secure Funds**
   - Move to hardware wallet
   - Verify all funds accounted for
   - Document transaction hashes

2. **Assess Damage**
   - Total funds affected
   - Number of users impacted
   - Root cause analysis
   - Prevention measures

3. **Plan Recovery**
   - Fix vulnerability
   - Test extensively
   - Prepare new contracts
   - Compensation plan if needed

4. **Redeploy**
   - Deploy fixed contracts
   - Migrate user data
   - Restore funds
   - Resume operations

## 🔍 MONITORING & DETECTION

### Automated Monitoring

#### Tenderly Alerts (Recommended)

```javascript
// Configure alerts for:
- Failed transactions (>5% rate)

- Repeated failed calls
- Admin function calls
- Contract state changes
```

#### OpenZeppelin Defender

```javascript
// Sentinel configuration:
- Monitor critical functions
- Alert on suspicious patterns
- Auto-pause on exploits
- Transaction simulation
- Gas price monitoring
```
