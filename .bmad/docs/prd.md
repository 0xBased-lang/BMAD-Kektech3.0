### Background Context

KEKTECH 3.0 represents the evolution of the KEKTECH ecosystem into decentralized prediction markets. The platform builds on existing KEKTECH infrastructure deployed on BASED Chain:

**Existing Assets:**
- **KEKTECH NFT Collection**: 4,200 NFTs deployed at `0x40B6184b901334C0A88f528c1A0a1de7a77490f1`
- **TECH Token**: ERC20 deployed at `0x62E8D022CAf673906e62904f7BB5ae467082b546`
- **Target Network**: BASED Chain (EVM-compatible, low fees, fast blocks)

**Previous Implementation (January 2025):**

A complete implementation was previously built and documented, achieving:
- **7 smart contracts** (6,124 lines total)
- **212 tests** (100% passing)
- **9.4/10 quality score**
- **3 revolutionary innovations** (250M+ gas saved)
- **18-20 hours** focused implementation time

**Why Rebuild:**

The original code is inaccessible, but **complete implementation documentation exists** (5,500+ lines across 4 documents):
- Step-by-step implementation timeline (14 phases)
- Complete technical specifications with all code examples
- All design decisions with rationale
- All test cases and expected results
- Measured gas costs for validation

This provides a **blueprint for precision recreation** with validated architecture (9.4/10 quality score).

**Rebuild Strategy:**

Follow the documented implementation timeline exactly, using BMAD methodology for systematic tracking. Each epic maps to original implementation phases. Each story includes code examples and acceptance criteria from documentation. Validate all metrics against documented targets.
