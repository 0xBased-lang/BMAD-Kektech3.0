### The 9 Critical Fixes

All discovered through validation and implemented exactly:

1. **Linear Fee Formula** - Prevents excessive fees
2. **Multiply Before Divide** - Prevents rounding errors
3. **Minimum Volume** - Prevents manipulation
4. **Pull Payment** - Prevents reentrancy
5. **Reversal Limits** - Max 2 reversals per market
6. **Grace Period** - 5-minute buffer after close
7. **Spam Prevention** - 100K bond + cooldown + blacklist
