## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

### System Components

The platform consists of 7 interconnected smart contracts organized in 4 layers:

#### Layer 1: Core Prediction Markets
1. **PredictionMarket.sol** (658 lines)
   - Individual market contract
   - Handles betting, resolution, winnings
   - Implements all 9 security fixes
   
2. **PredictionMarketFactory.sol** (507 lines)
   - Factory pattern for market creation
   - UUPS upgradeable proxy
   - Parameter management with timelock
   
3. **FactoryTimelock.sol** (213 lines) 🔒 CRITICAL
   - 48-hour delay on factory upgrades
   - Anti-rug-pull protection
   - Community review period

#### Layer 2: NFT Staking System
4. **EnhancedNFTStaking.sol** (612 lines) ⚡ INNOVATIVE
   - Deterministic rarity system (saves 200M gas!)
   - Voting power calculation
   - Batch staking operations
   
#### Layer 3: Governance & Bonds
5. **GovernanceContract.sol** (687 lines)
   - DAO governance system
   - Snapshot-based voting
   - Spam prevention (100K BASED bond)
   
6. **BondManager.sol** (380 lines)
   - Manages governance bonds
   - Refund/forfeit logic
   - Economic spam deterrent

#### Layer 4: Rewards Distribution
7. **RewardDistributor.sol** (453 lines)

   - Ultra gas-efficient (~47K per claim)
   - Scales to 10,000+ users

---

## CRITICAL INNOVATIONS

### 1. Deterministic Rarity System (200M Gas Saved!)

**Problem:** Traditional NFT rarity requires external metadata calls (~20K gas each)

**Solution:** Pure deterministic function based on token ID ranges

```solidity
function getRarityMultiplier(uint256 tokenId) public pure returns (uint256) {
    if (tokenId >= 9900) return 5;      // Mythic: 1%
    if (tokenId >= 9000) return 4;      // Legendary: 9%
    if (tokenId >= 8500) return 3;      // Epic: 5%
    if (tokenId >= 7000) return 2;      // Rare: 15%
    return 1;                            // Common: 70%
}
```

**Impact:**
- Zero external calls (pure function)
- ~300 gas vs ~20,000 gas per lookup
- ~200M gas saved across 10,000 staked NFTs
- Deterministic (predictable for users)
- Can be computed off-chain for UI

### 2. Timelock Security (Rug-Pull Prevention)

**Problem:** Upgradeable contracts can be exploited by malicious owners

**Solution:** 48-hour timelock on all factory upgrades

```solidity
function queueUpgrade(address newImplementation) external onlyOwner {
    // Queue upgrade with 48-hour delay
    upgradeTimelocks[txHash] = block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_DURATION;
    emit UpgradeQueued(newImplementation, upgradeTimelocks[txHash]);
}

function cancelUpgrade(bytes32 txHash) external {
    // ANYONE can cancel malicious upgrades
    cancelledTransactions[txHash] = true;
}
```

**Impact:**
- 48-hour community review period
- Anyone can cancel suspicious upgrades
- Maintains trust in the platform
- Prevents rug pulls

### 3. Merkle Tree Rewards (Massive Scalability)

**Problem:** Traditional airdrop costs ~100K+ gas per recipient

**Solution:** Merkle proof-based claiming system

```solidity
function claim(
    uint256 index,
    address account,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
) external {
    // Verify proof (~47K gas)
    bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(index, account, amount));
    require(MerkleProof.verify(merkleProof, merkleRoot, leaf), "Invalid proof");
    // ... transfer tokens ...
}
```

**Impact:**
- ~47K gas per claim (vs ~100K+ traditional)
- Scales to 10,000+ users efficiently
- Off-chain computation, on-chain verification
- IPFS metadata for transparency

## THE 9 CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES

All fixes were identified through validation and implemented exactly as specified:

### Fix #1: Linear Additional Fee Formula
**Issue:** Parabolic fees could become excessive at high volume  
**Solution:** Linear scaling (1,000 BASED = 1 bps additional fee)  
**Location:** PredictionMarket.sol:calculateAdditionalFee()

### Fix #2: Multiply Before Divide
**Issue:** Integer division causes rounding errors in winnings  
**Solution:** `(amount * pool) / total` instead of `(amount / total) * pool`  
**Location:** PredictionMarket.sol:claimWinnings()

### Fix #3: Minimum Volume or Refund
**Issue:** Low-volume markets can be manipulated  
**Solution:** Require ≥10,000 BASED volume or trigger automatic refund  
**Location:** PredictionMarket.sol:finalizeResolution()

### Fix #4: Pull Payment Pattern
**Issue:** Fee distribution vulnerable to reentrancy  
**Solution:** Separate claimCreatorFees() and claimPlatformFees()  
**Location:** PredictionMarket.sol (multiple functions)

### Fix #5: Emergency Reversal Limit
**Issue:** Unlimited reversals damage credibility  
**Solution:** MAX_REVERSALS = 2 per market  
**Location:** PredictionMarket.sol:reverseResolution()

### Fix #6: Grace Period for Late Bets
**Issue:** Front-running at market close  
**Solution:** 5-minute grace period after endTime  
**Location:** PredictionMarket.sol:placeBet()

### Fix #7: Governance Spam Prevention
**Issue:** Spam proposals could overwhelm DAO  
**Solution:** 100K BASED bond + 24h cooldown + blacklist after 3 fails  
**Location:** GovernanceContract.sol:createProposal()

### Fix #8: Cross-Parameter Validation
**Issue:** Individual parameter changes could violate total fee cap  
**Solution:** Validate total fees ≤7% on every parameter change  
**Location:** PredictionMarketFactory.sol:setParameters()

### Fix #9: Batch Operation Limits
**Issue:** Unlimited batch size could exceed gas limit  
**Solution:** MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100 NFTs per transaction  
**Location:** EnhancedNFTStaking.sol:stakeMultiple()
