## 🎯 EDGE CASE CATEGORIES

### Category 1: Token ID Boundary Edge Cases (12 tests) ✅

**Purpose:** Test all token ID boundaries for deterministic rarity system

**Rarity Distribution (4,200 NFTs):**
- Common (0-2939): 2,940 NFTs (70.00%) = 1x multiplier
- Uncommon (2940-3569): 630 NFTs (15.00%) = 2x multiplier
- Rare (3570-3779): 210 NFTs (5.00%) = 3x multiplier
- Epic (3780-4109): 330 NFTs (7.86%) = 4x multiplier
- Legendary (4110-4199): 90 NFTs (2.14%) = 5x multiplier

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Stake token ID 0 (first Common)
2. ✅ Stake token ID 2939 (last Common)
3. ✅ Stake token ID 2940 (first Uncommon)
4. ✅ Stake token ID 3569 (last Uncommon)
5. ✅ Stake token ID 3570 (first Rare)
6. ✅ Stake token ID 3779 (last Rare)
7. ✅ Stake token ID 3780 (first Epic)
8. ✅ Stake token ID 4109 (last Epic)
9. ✅ Stake token ID 4110 (first Legendary)
10. ✅ Stake token ID 4199 (last Legendary)
11. ✅ Reject token ID 4200 (invalid - exceeds max)
12. ✅ Reject token ID MAX_UINT256 (overflow)

**Key Findings:**
- Rarity boundaries enforced precisely
- Deterministic rarity calculation working correctly
- All rarity tiers properly assigned
- Invalid token IDs properly rejected

**Security:** ✅ No rarity manipulation vulnerabilities found

---

### Category 2: Batch Size Edge Cases (6 tests) ✅

**Purpose:** Test batch operation limits (MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 100)

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Reject batch of 0 NFTs
2. ✅ Stake batch of 1 NFT
3. ✅ Stake batch of exactly 100 NFTs (MAX_BATCH_SIZE)
4. ✅ Reject batch of 101 NFTs (exceeds MAX_BATCH_SIZE)
5. ✅ Handle batch with duplicate IDs (second stake fails)
6. ✅ Handle batch with mix of valid and owned NFTs

**Key Findings:**
- Batch size limit enforced precisely at 100 NFTs
- Empty batches properly rejected
- Duplicate IDs in batch handled correctly
- Ownership validated for each NFT in batch

**Security:** ✅ No batch manipulation vulnerabilities found

---

### Category 3: Stake Duration Edge Cases (6 tests) ✅

**Purpose:** Test 24-hour minimum stake duration boundaries

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Reject unstake immediately (0 duration)
2. ✅ Reject unstake at 23:59:59 (just before minimum)
3. ✅ Allow unstake at exactly 24:00:00
4. ✅ Allow unstake at 24:00:01 (just after minimum)
5. ✅ Allow emergency unstake (bypasses duration)
6. ✅ Handle multiple unstakes with different durations

**Key Findings:**
- Minimum duration enforced precisely at 24 hours (86,400 seconds)
- Emergency unstake bypasses duration check correctly
- Multiple stakes tracked independently
- Different durations handled correctly

**Security:** ✅ No duration bypass vulnerabilities found

---

### Category 4: Rarity Calculation Edge Cases (5 tests) ✅

**Purpose:** Test deterministic rarity calculation system

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Correctly calculate all rarity tiers
2. ✅ Correctly calculate all voting power multipliers
3. ✅ Aggregate voting power correctly for mixed rarities
4. ✅ Calculate rarity as pure function (no storage reads)
5. ✅ Handle rarity boundaries precisely

**Key Findings:**
- Pure function rarity calculation (300 gas vs 20,000 gas)
- All rarity tiers calculated correctly at boundaries
- Multipliers correct: Common (1x), Uncommon (2x), Rare (3x), Epic (4x), Legendary (5x)
- Aggregation working correctly for mixed rarities
- Deterministic (same result every time)

**Innovation:** 🚀 **Revolutionary gas savings: ~82,740,000 gas (~$4,000+ at typical gas prices)**

**Security:** ✅ No rarity manipulation vulnerabilities found

---

### Category 5: Ownership & Transfer Edge Cases (6 tests) ✅

**Purpose:** Test NFT ownership and transfer restrictions

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Reject staking NFT not owned
2. ✅ Reject staking already staked NFT
3. ✅ Prevent transfer of staked NFT
4. ✅ Reject unstaking NFT not staked by user
5. ✅ Reject double unstake
6. ✅ Handle emergency unstake all correctly

**Key Findings:**
- Ownership validated before staking
- Staked NFTs cannot be transferred (contract owns them)
- Unstaking restricted to stake owner
- Emergency unstake returns all NFTs correctly
- Double unstake properly prevented

**Security:** ✅ No ownership manipulation vulnerabilities found

---

### Category 6: Voting Power Edge Cases (7 tests) ✅

**Purpose:** Test voting power calculation and aggregation

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Calculate voting power for single stake
2. ✅ Aggregate voting power for multiple stakes
3. ✅ Update voting power after unstake
4. ✅ Track total voting power across all stakers
5. ✅ Handle zero voting power before staking
6. ✅ Calculate maximum voting power (all 4200 NFTs)
7. ✅ Handle voting power with mixed rarity stakes

**Key Findings:**
- Single stake voting power calculated correctly
- Multiple stakes aggregated correctly
- Voting power updated correctly after unstake
- Total voting power tracked across all stakers
- Zero voting power handled correctly
- Maximum theoretical voting power: 6,600 (verified calculation)
- Mixed rarity voting power aggregation working correctly

**Maximum Voting Power Calculation:**
- Common (2940 NFTs × 1x) = 2,940
- Uncommon (630 NFTs × 2x) = 1,260
- Rare (210 NFTs × 3x) = 630
- Epic (330 NFTs × 4x) = 1,320
- Legendary (90 NFTs × 5x) = 450
- **TOTAL: 6,600 voting power** ✅

**Security:** ✅ No voting power manipulation vulnerabilities found
