# 🎯 FACTORY BULLETPROOF TEST STATUS

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS - NEEDS API UPDATE**
**Progress:** Test file created, setup fixed, API mismatch found

---

## ✅ COMPLETED

1. Created comprehensive 30-test Factory edge case suite
2. Fixed token setup (using MockERC20)
3. Fixed Factory constructor parameters
4. Identified MarketParams struct API requirement

---

## ⏳ REMAINING WORK

### Update Required: createMarket API

**Current calls use:**
```javascript
factory.connect(creator).createMarket(
  "Question?",
  ["YES", "NO"],
  endTime,
  resolutionTime,
  resolver.address,
  100,  // creator fee
  200   // platform fee
)
```

**Should use:**
```javascript
factory.connect(creator).createMarket({
  question: "Question?",
  endTime: endTime,
  resolutionTime: resolutionTime,
  resolver: resolver.address,
  outcomes: ["YES", "NO"]
})
```

**Files needing update:**
- `test/factory-bulletproof-edge-cases.test.js` (all createMarket calls)
