2. **Security First**: All 9 security fixes thoroughly validated
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Test actual user flows, not just unit tests
4. **Attack Thinking**: Try to break the system in every way possible
5. **Integration Focus**: Ensure all contracts work together perfectly
6. **Automated Validation**: Scripts run automatically, zero manual checks
7. **Clear Reporting**: Instant visibility into what passed/failed and why

async function testFunctionality() {
    console.log("\n📝 Testing: [Test Name]");
    console.log("─".repeat(50));

    try {
        // 1. Setup
        const initialState = await getState();
        console.log("   Initial state:", initialState);

        // 2. Execute
        const tx = await contract.function(params);
        await tx.wait();
        console.log("   ✅ Transaction successful:", tx.hash);

        // 3. Validate
        const finalState = await getState();
        console.log("   Final state:", finalState);

        // 4. Verify
        assert(finalState === expectedState, "State mismatch!");
        console.log("   ✅ Validation passed!");

        return { success: true, test: "Test Name" };

    } catch (error) {
        console.error("   ❌ Test failed:", error.message);
        return { success: false, test: "Test Name", error: error.message };
    }
}
```

### Test Result Tracking

```javascript
const testResults = {
    total: 0,
    passed: 0,
    failed: 0,
    skipped: 0,
    errors: []
};

// Update after each test
function recordResult(result) {
    testResults.total++;
    if (result.success) {
        testResults.passed++;
    } else {
        testResults.failed++;
        testResults.errors.push(result);
    }
