## 🎯 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Complete Deployment (2-3 hours)

**Deploy ALL contracts in correct order:**

```yaml
Step 1: Deploy BondManager
  Constructor: (BASED_token, treasury)
  Validate: Contract deployed, methods accessible

Step 2: Deploy EnhancedNFTStaking (already done, but redeploy for clean state)
  Constructor: (KEKTECH_NFT_address)
  Validate: NFT integration working

Step 3: Deploy GovernanceContract
  Constructor: (BondManager, Factory_temp, Staking)
  Validate: Links to BondManager + Staking

Step 4: Link BondManager ↔ Governance
  Call: bondManager.setGovernance(governance_address)
  Validate: Governance can call bond functions

Step 5: Deploy FactoryTimelock
  Constructor: (owner)
  Validate: Timelock operational

Step 6: Deploy PredictionMarket (reference)
  Constructor: (factory_temp, params)
  Validate: Market contract deployed

Step 7: Deploy PredictionMarketFactory
  Constructor: (BASED, treasury, market_impl, fee_params)
  Validate: Factory can create markets

Step 8: Link Factory ↔ Timelock
  Call: factory.setTimelock(timelock_address)
  Validate: Parameter updates use timelock

Step 9: Update Governance with Factory
  Call: governance.setFactory(factory_address)
  Validate: Complete system linked

Step 10: Deploy RewardDistributor
  Constructor: (BASED, TECH, distributor)
  Validate: Token integration working

### Phase 3: System Integration Testing (2-3 hours)

**Test complete user journeys:**

#### Journey 1: Staking → Voting

```yaml
Scenario: User stakes NFT and votes on proposal

Steps:
  1. User has KEKTECH NFT (simulate on fork)
  2. Approve NFT to staking contract
  3. Stake NFT (ID 0-4199)
  4. Verify voting power assigned
  5. Proposer creates governance proposal
  6. User votes with weighted power
  7. Proposal passes/fails based on votes
  8. User unstakes NFT
  9. Voting power removed

Validations:
  ✅ NFT transfer works
  ✅ Voting power calculated correctly
  ✅ Vote counts properly
  ✅ Unstake returns NFT
  ✅ All gas costs reasonable
```

#### Journey 2: Governance Proposal Lifecycle

```yaml
Scenario: Full proposal from creation to execution

Steps:
  1. Proposer has 100K BASED
  2. Proposer stakes NFT for voting power
  3. Approve BASED to BondManager
  4. Create proposal (bond locked)
  5. Wait 24 hours (voting period)
  6. Multiple users vote (weighted)
  7. Voting period ends
  8. Check participation >10%
  9. Check approval >50%

Scenario: Create market, bet, resolve, claim

Steps:
  1. Creator calls factory.createMarket()
  2. Market deployed with params
  3. User A bets 100 BASED on Yes
  4. User B bets 200 BASED on No
  5. AMM adjusts prices
  6. Market end time reached
  7. Resolver sets outcome (Yes wins)
  8. User A claims winnings
  9. Platform fee to treasury
  10. Creator fee distributed

Validations:
  ✅ Market created successfully
  ✅ Bets processed correctly
  ✅ AMM calculations accurate
  ✅ Resolution works
  ✅ Winner claims correct amount
  ✅ Fees distributed properly
  ✅ Loser cannot claim
```

#### Journey 4: Reward Distribution

```yaml
Scenario: DAO publishes rewards, users claim

Steps:
  1. DAO generates merkle tree
  2. DAO publishes distribution
  3. User generates proof off-chain
  4. User claims BASED rewards
  5. User claims TECH rewards
  6. Bitmap marks as claimed
  7. User tries to claim again (fails)

Validations:
  ✅ Distribution published
  ✅ Merkle proof valid
  ✅ BASED tokens transferred
  ✅ TECH tokens transferred
  ✅ Double-claim prevented
  ✅ Gas costs ~47K per claim
```

---

### Phase 4: Edge Cases & Attack Scenarios (3-4 hours)

**Test unusual & malicious scenarios:**

#### Attack Scenario 1: Governance Spam Attack

```yaml
Attacker Strategy: Flood governance with proposals

Defense Layers:
  1. Bond Requirement (100K BASED)
     → Attacker needs 100K per proposal
     → Economic deterrent

  2. Cooldown (24 hours)
     → Only 1 proposal per day
     → Limits spam rate

  3. Blacklist (3 failures)
     → Failed proposals forfeit bond
     → 3 failures = permanent ban

Test:
  ✅ Attacker creates proposal 1 (bond locked)
  ✅ Proposal fails with <10% participation
  ✅ Bond forfeited to treasury
  ✅ Try to create proposal 2 (fails - cooldown)
  ✅ Wait 24 hours, create proposal 2
  ✅ Proposal 2 fails, bond forfeited
  ✅ Repeat for proposal 3
  ✅ Blacklisted after 3 failures
  ✅ Cannot create more proposals

Result: SPAM PREVENTED ✅
```

#### Attack Scenario 2: Flash Loan Voting Attack

```yaml
Attacker Strategy: Borrow NFTs, vote, return

Defense: Snapshot Voting
  → Voting power captured at proposal creation
  → Cannot manipulate after snapshot
  → Flash loans useless

Test:
  ✅ Proposal created (snapshot taken)
  ✅ Attacker stakes NFT after snapshot
  ✅ Attacker tries to vote
  ✅ Voting power = 0 (snapshot doesn't include new stake)
  ✅ Attack FAILS

Result: FLASH LOAN VOTING PREVENTED ✅
```

#### Attack Scenario 3: Reentrancy Attack

```yaml
Target: Reward claims, governance execution

Defense: ReentrancyGuard + Checks-Effects-Interactions

Test:
  ✅ Malicious contract implements receive() hook
  ✅ Malicious contract claims reward
  ✅ receive() tries to claim again
  ✅ ReentrancyGuard blocks second call
  ✅ Attack FAILS

Result: REENTRANCY PREVENTED ✅
```

#### Attack Scenario 4: Front-Running Market Bets

```yaml
Attacker Strategy: Front-run large bets to profit

Reality: AMM makes this unprofitable
  → Large bet A moves price
  → Attacker bet B gets worse price
  → Attacker loses to AMM fees

Test:
  ✅ Large bet moves AMM price
  ✅ Front-run bet gets slippage
  ✅ Fees reduce profit margin
  ✅ Attack UNPROFITABLE

Result: FRONT-RUNNING MITIGATED ✅
```

#### Attack Scenario 5: Parameter Manipulation

```yaml
Attacker Strategy: Malicious owner changes fees

Defense: FactoryTimelock (48-hour delay)
  → Cannot change fees instantly
  → Community has time to react
  → Can exit if malicious

Test:
  ✅ Owner queues fee update (90% fee)
  ✅ Cannot execute immediately
  ✅ Wait 48 hours
  ✅ Community sees malicious intent
  ✅ Users withdraw before execution
  ✅ Malicious owner loses users

Result: PARAMETER PROTECTION WORKING ✅
```

---

### Phase 5: Emergency Procedures (1-2 hours)

**Test pause/unpause and recovery:**

```yaml
Scenario 1: Emergency Pause Staking
  ✅ Owner calls pause()
  ✅ Users cannot stake
  ✅ Users cannot unstake
  ✅ Owner calls unpause()
  ✅ Functions resume

Scenario 2: Critical Bug Discovery
  ✅ Bug discovered in production
  ✅ Pause all affected contracts
  ✅ Users' funds safe (locked, not lost)
  ✅ Deploy fix contracts
  ✅ Unpause after verification

Scenario 3: Malicious Market
  ✅ Factory owner pauses factory
  ✅ No new markets can be created
  ✅ Existing markets continue
  ✅ Fix and unpause

Scenario 4: Emergency Withdrawal
  ✅ Test emergency withdrawal patterns
  ✅ Ensure users can always recover funds
  ✅ No funds permanently locked
```

---

### Phase 6: Gas Cost Validation (1 hour)

**Measure actual gas costs on fork:**

```yaml
Staking Operations:
  ✅ Stake NFT: ~____K gas
  ✅ Unstake NFT: ~____K gas
  ✅ Batch stake (10): ~____K gas

Governance Operations:
  ✅ Create proposal: ~____K gas
  ✅ Vote: ~____K gas
  ✅ Finalize: ~____K gas

Market Operations:
  ✅ Create market: ~____K gas
  ✅ Place bet: ~____K gas
  ✅ Resolve: ~____K gas
  ✅ Claim: ~____K gas

Reward Operations:
  ✅ Publish distribution: ~____K gas
  ✅ Claim reward: ~____K gas
  ✅ Batch claim (10): ~____K gas

Total Deployment Cost:
  ✅ All 7 contracts: ~____M gas
  ✅ At current gas price: ~$____
  ✅ Within budget? ✅
```
