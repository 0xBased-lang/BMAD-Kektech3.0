## üîê Security Best Practices

### Access Control

**Mainnet Deployment Recommendations:**

1. **Use Multisig for Contract Owner**
   ```
   - Gnosis Safe or equivalent
   - 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 signatures
   - Geographically distributed signers
   - Regular key rotation
   ```

2. **Private Key Management**
   ```
   - Hardware wallets for all signers
   - Never store keys in plain text
   - Use environment variables properly
   - Regular security audits
   ```

3. **Deployment Account Security**
   ```
   - Separate deployment account
   - Minimum balance (only what's needed)
   - Transfer ownership after deployment
   - Document all transactions
   ```

### Operational Security

1. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Real-time event monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert escalation procedures
   - 24/7 coverage for first week

2. **Incident Response**
   - Emergency procedures documented
   - Team trained on procedures
   - Regular drills
   - Post-incident reviews

3. **Code & Deployment**
   - All code in version control
   - Deployment scripts tested
   - Artifacts saved and backed up
   - Verification on block explorer
