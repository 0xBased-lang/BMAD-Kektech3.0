## DETAILED TOPIC BREAKDOWN

### Smart Contracts (Section 2)

#### Core Infrastructure (2.1-2.3)
- **Registry** (2.1): Contract directory, service locator pattern
- **ParameterStorage** (2.2): Configuration management, global + market overrides
- **FlexibleMarketFactory** (2.3): Market creation, template registration

#### Market Implementations (2.4-2.5)
- **PredictionMarket** (2.4): Binary YES/NO betting with complete lifecycle
- **MultiOutcomeMarket** (2.5): N-outcome markets (e.g., sports with draws)
- Template: CrowdfundingMarket (funding rounds with betting)

#### Governance & Management (2.6-2.9)
- **ProposalSystem** (2.6): Market proposals, voting, creation orchestration
- **EnhancedNFTStaking** (2.7): NFT staking with rarity-based weight calculation
- **RewardDistributor** (2.8): Merkle tree-based reward claiming
- **BondManager** (2.9): Bond escrow and refund management

### Economic Model (Section 3)

#### Creator Incentives (3.1)
- Bond-based fee: 10-100 bps (by bond size 5K-100K)
- Additional fee: Linear (1000 BASED = 1 bps)
- Combined: Up to 200 bps (2.0%)
- Purpose: Align creator quality with incentives

#### Fee Distribution (3.2-3.3)
- Platform: 3.0% fixed (team 1%, treasury 1.5%, burn 0.5%)
- Creator: 0.1-2.0% variable
- Extraction: During finalization (not claiming)
- Cap: 5.0% total maximum

#### Market Mechanics (4.1-4.2)
- One-sided markets: Fees create natural price discovery
- Bond refundability: Enables capital reuse
- Proposal costs: Bond (refundable) + fee (spent) + 1% tax

### NFT Staking System (Section 5)

#### Rarity Mechanism
- **Common**: 1.0x (20% of collection)
- **Rare**: 1.25x (20%)
- **Epic**: 1.75x (30%)
- **Legendary**: 3.0x (20%)
- **Mythic**: 5.0x (10%)
- Setup: On-chain mapping, batch-configurable

#### Reward Mechanics
- Calculation: Weekly from TECH emissions + trading fees
- Distribution: Merkle tree-based (off-chain compute, on-chain verify)
- Frequency: Weekly
- Claiming: Multi-period batching supported

### User Journeys (Section 7)

#### Market Creator Path
1. Plan market + calculate incentives
2. Submit proposal (bond + fee + 1% tax)
3. Community votes (7 days)
4. Market created (if approved)
5. Collect fees + refunded bond

#### Bettor/Trader Path
1. Find market, analyze odds
2. Place bet (send BASED)
3. Wait for resolution
4. Claim winnings (if correct)

#### NFT Staker Path
1. Own KEKTECH NFT, check rarity
2. Stake NFT (approve + transfer)
3. Earn weekly rewards (after 24h)
4. Vote on proposals (with weight)
5. Claim rewards, unstake anytime

## KEY FORMULAS

### Creator Fee Calculation
```
feeBPS = 10 + ((bond - 5000) / 95000) × 90
additionalFeeBPS = additionalFee / 1000
totalCreatorFeeBPS = feeBPS + additionalFeeBPS
```

**Examples**:
- 5K bond only: 10 bps = 0.1%
- 50K bond + 40K fee: 52.63 + 40 = 92.63 bps = 0.926%
- 100K bond + 100K fee: 100 + 100 = 200 bps = 2.0%

### Fee Extraction
```
totalVolume = totalYes + totalNo
teamFee = (totalVolume × teamFeeBPS) / 10000
treasuryFee = (totalVolume × treasuryFeeBPS) / 10000
burnFee = (totalVolume × burnFeeBPS) / 10000
creatorFee = (totalVolume × creatorFeeBPS) / 10000
```

### Winner Payout
```
winningPool = outcome ? totalYes : totalNo
userWinningAmount = positions[user][outcome]
userShare = (userWinningAmount / winningPool) × (remainingPoolAfterFees)
```

### Voting Power (Tiered)
```
if (stakedCount >= 10):    power = stakedCount × 5
else if (stakedCount >= 5): power = stakedCount × 3
else if (stakedCount >= 1): power = stakedCount × 1
else:                       power = 0
```

### Reward Distribution
```
userWeight = sum of (rarityMultiplier for each staked NFT)
totalNetworkWeight = sum of all staker weights
userShare = (userWeight / totalNetworkWeight) × weeklyRewards
```

## CRITICAL MECHANICS

### 1. Grace Period (5 minutes)
- **Purpose**: Prevent race conditions at market end
- **When**: Between endTime and resolution start
- **Effect**: Clear separation of betting vs. resolution phases

### 2. Maximum Reversals (2)
- **Purpose**: Limit correction window
- **Allowed**: Up to 2 emergency reversals during 48-hour window
- **Effect**: After 2nd reversal, no more changes possible

### 3. Minimum Volume (10,000 BASED)
- **Purpose**: Prevent integer division rounding loss
- **Effect**: Creator always earns minimum fees on finalization
- **Requirement**: Market must have >= 10,000 BASED to finalize

### 4. Fee Extraction Timing
- **When**: During finalize() call (not during individual claims)
- **Who**: Resolver/owner (they pay gas)
- **Benefit**: All claimers have equal gas costs

### 5. 24-Hour Staking Minimum
- **Purpose**: Prevent flash loan attacks on voting
- **Effect**: Rewards only accrue after 24-hour hold
- **Flexibility**: Can unstake anytime after 24h

### 6. Tiered Voting (NFT-based)
- **Purpose**: Give larger holders more influence
- **Tiers**: 1-4 NFTs (1x), 5-9 NFTs (3x), 10+ NFTs (5x)
- **Toggleable**: Can be disabled for flat voting

## SECURITY HIGHLIGHTS

### Fixed Issues (From Validation Report)

1. **Integer Division Rounding** → MIN_TOTAL_VOLUME = 10,000 BASED
2. **First Claimer Gas Burden** → Fee extraction in finalize()
3. **Infinite Reversals** → MAX_REVERSALS = 2
4. **Race Conditions** → 5-minute RESOLUTION_GRACE_PERIOD
5. **Proposal Spam** → Blacklist + 24-hour cooldown
6. **Parameter Validation** → Cross-parameter fee cap checking
7. **Batch Limits** → MAX_STAKE_PER_TX = 50 (tested on mainnet)

### Protection Mechanisms

- **Reentrancy Guards**: `nonReentrant` modifier on all external functions
- **Access Control**: Role-based (Owner, Resolver, Users)
- **Parameter Flexibility**: All values adjustable without redeployment
- **Emergency Functions**: Reversal, refund, blacklisting

---
