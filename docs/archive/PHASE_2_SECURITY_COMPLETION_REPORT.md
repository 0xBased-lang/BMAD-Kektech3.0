## Testing Strategy & Methodology

### Test Design Principles
1. **Defense-in-Depth Testing:** Test both primary and backup security mechanisms
2. **State Machine Coverage:** Test all state transitions and invalid transitions
3. **Boundary Testing:** Test limits, caps, and threshold values
4. **Edge Case Focus:** Explicitly test zero amounts, empty arrays, and extreme values
5. **Integration Validation:** Test security fixes work together, not just in isolation

### Special Testing Techniques

#### Early Resolution Markets (Fix #9)
To properly test Fix #9's defense-in-depth protection, we created markets where `resolutionTime` falls within the grace period:
```javascript
currentTime + 86400 * 7,        // endTime: 7 days
currentTime + 86400 * 7 + 120,  // resolutionTime: 7 days + 2 minutes (within grace!)
```
This allows testing the `proposedAt == 0` check which is unreachable in normal market configurations.

#### High Volume Scenarios (Fee Cap Testing)
Accumulated >50,000 BASED volume to trigger maximum additional fee cap:
```javascript
await predictionMarket.connect(alice).placeBet(0, toWei(20000));
await predictionMarket.connect(bob).placeBet(1, toWei(20000));
await predictionMarket.connect(carol).placeBet(0, toWei(15000));
// Total: ~55,000 BASED → triggers 50 bps cap
```

#### REFUNDING State Verification
Placed bets below minimum volume threshold to trigger REFUNDING state:
```javascript
// Total bets: 5,000 BASED < 10,000 minimum
await predictionMarket.connect(alice).placeBet(0, toWei(2000));
await predictionMarket.connect(bob).placeBet(1, toWei(3000));
// finalizeResolution() → state = REFUNDING
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Defense-in-Depth is Critical:** Fix #9 demonstrates value even when unreachable in normal operation
2. **Test Timing is Complex:** Grace period + resolution time interactions require careful test design
3. **State Machine Testing:** Comprehensive state transition coverage prevents edge case bugs
4. **Fee Calculation:** Linear formulas with caps require testing at boundaries and beyond

### Testing Best Practices
1. **Special Market Configurations:** Create markets with non-standard parameters to test edge cases
2. **Fresh Market Instances:** Ensure clean state for tests verifying initial conditions
3. **Enum Awareness:** Always verify enum values, don't assume (CREATED=0, ACTIVE=1, etc.)
4. **Fee Awareness in Assertions:** Account for fee deductions when verifying bet amounts

### Process Improvements
1. **Incremental Testing:** Add tests immediately after implementing fixes
2. **Coverage-Driven Development:** Monitor coverage continuously, not just at end
3. **Test Organization:** Group related tests in dedicated files for maintainability
4. **Documentation Embedded:** Write test descriptions that serve as documentation
